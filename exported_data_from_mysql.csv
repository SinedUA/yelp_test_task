We believe the success with which our current and past students navigate the water proves our program's effectiveness.The most important aspect of our teaching process is our disciplined but loving dedication to getting children in and comfortable with the water. We are thoughtful and observant of student's behavioral and developmental patterns, and will never scare or intimidate a student. We will respond to their fears and concerns with love, humor and discipline, while guiding them through the necessary steps to become independent, competent swimmers.We deeply enjoy helping with children with special needs and development issues.  They are some of our favorite and best students!  The aquatic environment can provide them with a unique athletic experience other sports cannot.This firm, loving approach is the hallmark of SwimJim.
SwimJim was started in one location with 4 team members and 60 clients.  We only had lessons one day a week. Since that time SwimJim has expanded to multiple locations around New York City and has opened in the Hamptons and Houston Texas. The school now operates 7 days a week and 50 weeks out of the year. During that time of growth we created the Underwater Schoolhouse Teaching methodology added elite level swimmer and Olympic Gold Medalist Catherine Fox to the educational development team.  Together Jim and Catherine have developed a program that is world renowned and they have lectured and done clinics around the world. Their focus is on educating the whole person by addressing the emotional needs as well as the physical needs of the student. As SwimJim Continues to expand and grow, the entire team is focused on learning and discovering new ways to grow, educate and teach all people how to be safer in, on and around the water and enjoy the magic of swimming",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6lh4V5Fj-WpqZVBfPO_ohA/l.jpg,1

Asphalt Green is a non-profit sports and fitness organization in New York City that was founded by Dr. George E. Murphy, a professor of pathology at the Cornell University Medical College, and his wife, Annette. In 1972, the Murphy's, along with local residents, formed a charitable organization to renovate the Municipal Asphalt Plant and create Asphalt Green, a community center that offers sports activities. Asphalt Green officially opened in 1984 on the site of the former Municipal Asphalt Plant. The interior of plant was rehabilitated to house a gymnasium and multi-purpose classrooms.  In 1985, the outdoor turf sports field was added and in 1993, the AquaCenter was built next door, including a 50-meter Olympic pool and a 15,000 square-foot Fitness Center. In 2013, Asphalt Green opened a second location in lower Manhattan in Battery Park City.

MoshFit was inspired by Punk Rope, which Tim Haft launched in 2004. Punk Rope is now the most popular rope-jumping based fitness class in the world, but Tim realized long ago that not everybody likes to jump rope. He wanted to create a fitness class with the same playful spirit and high energy as Punk Rope, but minus the rope jumping. Tim also wanted to offer a class that could be taught in a wide variety of settings not just gyms. Since MoshFit requires no equipment it can be offered virtually anywhere including the back room of a tiki bar",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4690yE6WwCMvAf0X8Byn8A/l.jpg,6

My in studio Pilates equipment sessions in NYC's East Village are geared toward your needs whether that is injury rehab, injury prevention, or fitness. In-home yoga and Pilates is also available in some areas of NYC. My intuitive knowing allows me to locate the root cause of a body block. I also offer phone life coaching sessions that combine Akashic Record intuitive work and Art Therapy principles. Each session begins with a quick grounding meditation and body scan before exploring your intention and direction for the session.
In 2005 I completed my Pilates equipment certification with the Kane School in NYC. In the same year I earned my Masters in Creative Art Therapy at Pratt University. Since then I have created a diverse practice that includes private Pilates instruction at studios in NYC, home sessions for Pilates and Yoga, fitness consulting for videos and print and phone sessions for life coaching based in art therapy, meditation and Akashic Records.

Our signature fitness program is Semi-Private Training, and it offers 100% personalized and customized fitness programs in an intimate 3:1 setting, coached by some of the best personal trainers in Manhattan. We've trained Olympic hopefuls, fitness newbies, people recovering from injuries, and everyone in between. If you're a human, you WILL benefit from restoring the authentic human movement that lives in your DNA. The facility also features an on-site clinic led by world renowned chiropractor, Dr. Kathy Dooley. Our clinicians combine manual therapy with movement drills to treat dysfunctional patterns that are the root cause of pain and dysfunctional movement patterns. We utilize cutting edge functional modalities, including the Selective Functional Movement Assessment (SFMA), NeuroKinetic Therapy (NKT), active stretching, restorative breathing, and Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS).
Catalyst SPORT was founded with a simple mission: we help people just like you live better lives by helping you to move better and get stronger. As personal trainers with thousands upon thousands of hours of experience, Catalyst Co-Founders Joe Boffi and Jason Kapnick came to realize a simple truth: clients who move better make faster progress and get hurt less than those with poor movement patterns (for example, think of the ability to squat deeply, or the flexibility to touch your toes). When we met world-renowned Chiropractor Dr. Kathy Dooley and the three of us founded Catalyst, the results were nothing short of magical: a gym that helps you get strong without hurting you; one that restores movement and uses that quality of movement to propel your fitness to new heights",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gdml1MfHYI4DK87d6comog/l.jpg,22

Control Kickboxing was born in Philadelphia in 2013. We saw a huge void in the training world. On one end was fitness boxing/kickboxing with little functionality. On the other end was the intimidating fighter gyms. Control Kickboxing was the solution, the middle ground. We built our program to give the everyday person a FUNCTIONAL knowledge of the arts. We wanted to provide high-level technique to everyone.Prashant, the creator of Control Kickboxing, spent over 2 years commuting from Philly to NYC in hopes of bringing his program to his home-city. After tons of hustle, Control Kickboxing made its official NYC debut in 2017.

The basic principal involves controlled, precise movements of drawing the sword from it's scabbard (saya), striking or cutting an opponent, removing blood from the blade (chuburi), and then replacing the sword in the scabbard.Iaido teaches the use of actual metal weaponry, these techniques are real (this is not a sport). These techniques are taught through forms (kata). We also have partner practice or sparring (kumadachi), where we use wooden swords (bokken). All students use an unsharpened sword (iaito) for safety reasons. We also practice cutting bamboo mats (tameshigiri), for this we use real sharpened swords under very close supervision.NYB is one of four schools in the US that teaches Ryushin Shouchi Ryu...
In the memory of Yoshitsune Otani Sensei (1929 - 2002), NYBA is a nonprofit organization (501(c) 3, whose mission is to practice and sustain the techniques, philosophies, and benefits of the Japanese martial arts. We are also promoting culture, physical and mental growth, health and well-being as well as non-denominational spirituality. These traditional Japanese arts are a Do (xe9x81x93) (or Tao in Chinese), a Way, through which one strives to reveal the true self. By bringing this true self forward, one is transformed, and so also is the world.  Our focus is the study of Iaido (xe5xb1x85xe5x90x88xe9x81x93) the drawing of the Japanese sword, specifically Ryushin Shouchi Ryu (xe6x9fxb3xe5xbfx83xe7x85xa7xe6x99xbaxe6xb5x81), under the guidance of Soke Kunikazu Yahagi (Honbu in Tokyo).

Established in 1999Bikram Yoga NYC opened its doors in August 1999 and became Manhattan's first Bikram Yoga Studio. Owners Donna Rubin and Jennifer Lobo had both been avid practitioners of Bikram Yoga in other cities and knew that no city needed Bikram Yoga more than New York. In choosing the first location, Donna Rubin, a former Broadway performer, felt that there was a need for a place for pre-show warm-up in the theater district as the theaters themselves offered no space for stretching. In its first year, many performers, musicians and stage workers filled the classes at the 8th avenue location as a new way to stretch, de-stress and stay in shape.Word quickly spread about the amazing benefits of Bikram Yoga and in in 2001, Bikram Yoga NYC opened two more studios on the upper west side and downtown. In 2002, the Flatiron location was opened and in 2006, Bikram Yoga NYC opened its largest studio on the Upper East side",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zShlepFhykF1uxs3ZK7EBw/l.jpg,87

Maggie sees all forms of art as interconnected, which is why she enjoys creativity in all forms from photography to hair styling and makeup, to painting, calligraphy, and composing poetry. It is all a part of her journey as an artist.Maggie Law has been passionate for drawing and painting since she was a child in China. In 2003, her oil painting Rebecca and her pastel painting Serenity won the first and second place, respectively, in a competition sponsored by the Artist Magazine. Her paintings have been exhibited at The Grace Gallery and the National Art Club in New York. And many of her paintings and drawings have been acquired by private collectors.As a photographer and fine-art painter based in New York, Maggie's photography clients include the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance in Manhattan, Finnish supermodel Angelika Kallio, the Gomez Dance Company and for the romantic comedy novel Metropolicks authored by Felicia Lin and Victor Rodriguez. Her photographic works have been selected for many commercials and professional publications, such as the Finnish fashion magazine Inside, The New York Times, and in the autobiography of Angelika Kallio...

We are thoughtful and observant of student's behavioral and developmental patterns, and will never scare or intimidate a student. We will respond to their fears and concerns with love, humor and discipline, while guiding them through the necessary steps to become independent, competent swimmers.We deeply enjoy helping with children with special needs and development issues.

Since that time SwimJim has expanded to multiple locations around New York City and has opened in the Hamptons and Houston Texas. The school now operates 7 days a week and 50 weeks out of the year. During that time of growth we created the Underwater Schoolhouse Teaching methodology added elite level swimmer and Olympic Gold Medalist Catherine Fox to the educational development team.

Sun Closed","Capoeira is an African-Brazilian art form that combines dance, martial arts, music and acrobatics. Africans in Brazil created Capoeira over 400 years ago as a way to defend themselves and maintain their culture in the face of the harsh and oppressive conditions of slavery. Capoeira and Capoeiristas - those who practice the art - have survived tremendous odds to develop their art form while facing discrimination from the upper and middle classes of Brazilian society. Capoeira was illegal to practice up until the early 1930s, when legendary Mestre Bimba founded the first legal Capoeira Academy and created a new, contemporary style of the art, Capoeira Regional. Practiced in a circle called a roda (pronounced ho-dah) and accompanied by live music, Capoeira can be graceful or combative as the situation dictates. Originally considered a lower class pastime, Capoeira is now a living art and profound social force throughout the world.
Omulu Guanabara group is led by world-renowned Capoeira masters, Mestre Preguixc3xa7a and Mestre Di Mola. After maintaining two separate Capoeira groups, the two Mestres joined forces and created Omulu Guanabara, one of the worlds most respected and recognized Capoeira schools. The group's mission is to promote the art of Capoeira through the development of high-quality training academies, professional performance groups, and community culture and education programs. Chapters include San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Minneapolis, Sweden, Brazil, Canada, Venezuela and Mexico.You do not need any prior knowledge to start - classes are mixed level and open to beginners. Classes begin with a series of Capoeira exercises and stretches to strengthen and warm-up the body. Individual Capoeira moves and sequences are then practiced in pairs or separately across the floor. The class ends with a roda - the circle in which Capoeira and music is played",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W4hLPke3wScbUrkjhfCDbw/o.jpg,1

These are Philosophy, Policy, Logistics, Strategy, Tactics and Skills.Philosophy is the basis of the art. We do not teach religion or mysticism. Elements of East Asian culture are inherent in some skill sets, but our philosophy consists in the principles of the American Founding and its roots in the Enlightenment of Western and Northern Europe.Skills are divided into three categories: weapons skills, boxing and trapping skills, and grappling and tumbling skills. Weapons include firearms, and Japanese and Filipino edged and blunt weapons.Boxing and trapping skills include elements of karate, Estacada, and other methods.Grappling and tumbling skills include Aiki jujutsu and some elements of Judo, wrestling, and other methods.There is no competition. There are no provisions for children. Firearms trainees must be licensed and vetted.
Having returned from eight years of training in Japan and nearly three more in California, I resumed training under local instructors. I had acted as an assistant instructor for two of my teachers in Kyoto, Osaka and LA. They wanted me to open a branch dojo under their auspices when I returned to NYC. I was reluctant to do this, but during my first year back, several persons suggested that I open a school. I was approached by a few investors, whose offers I turned down with thanks.

Students of all backgrounds, religions, ages, and athletic ability can train at Temple. Students come to the USA Shaolin Temple from all around the world to learn and grow from traditional Shaolin training. Heart to Heart and Mind to Mind is the essence of Shaolin Chan Philosophy -- and this system of training spans the differences between language and culture as a direct form of growth and understanding. Students find many paths to get to the Temple; while some students seek to build better health and create a feeling of well-being, others may train for self-defense or flexibility, but there is a singular concept behind Shaolin training: martial arts and Chan Philosophy are one and the same.
The USA Shaolin Temple was founded in 1994 by 34th Generation Shaolin Temple Warrior Monk, Shi Yan Ming. The Temple teaches Chan philosophy or Action Meditation, continuing the tradition as founded by Bodhidharma (Putidamo) in the year 527. The USA Shaolin Temple is located in New York City and has branches in Austria, Mexico, South Africa, Chile, Trinidad and Tobago and Argentina",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G7iq9NaOIVWd1nDFHm8G1Q/l.jpg,23

Orangetheory Fitness is a one-of-a-kind workout broken into intervals of cardiovascular and strength training, using a variety of equipment including treadmills, rowing, TRX straps, and free weights to tone your body and gain energy throughout the day.
The physiological theory behind the Orangetheory workout is known as Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption, or EPOC. By providing you with a heart rate monitor and POD, we can monitor your 5 zone interval training sessions that we call the Orange 60. During the 60 minute workout, you will perform multiple intervals designed to produce12 minutes or more of training at 84% or higher of your maximum heart rate, which translates to Zones 4/5. This program design produces EPOC, which is the workout after-burn effect, meaning that our interval training design produces a 200-400 calorie increase to your metabolism 24-36 hours after your workout",https://house-fastly.us-east-1.ooyala.com/RpcDNkajE6guNGOCOKeTqxpTa4J04IkR/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjBhOzV3Va,8

Rachel saw a huge missing in the services available for people wanting to learn about their health, take action to change their lifestyle and succeed.   Providing information and education is the first component.  Clients then need to be trained to let go of behaviors and habits that sabotage meeting their goals.  Beyond the clinical scientific studies, Rachel took on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ontology, and Coaching training to create her method.  Clients are coached through a lifestyle transformation that creates a permanent shift in their relatedness to food and, therefrom, their relatedness to self.Since Rachel began in March 2013, she has developed several programs to guide clients through that change with lessons, challenges, and accountability.  The written version of this program is in process and is projected to be in print by Fall 2015",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W2p2243-inB0-NHNSIF4Tw/l.jpg,1

Raymond Silva, PTRaymond Silva has been a physical therapist for over 15 years. He first became interested in physical therapy in high school when his grandmother's sister suffered a stroke. Her everyday function was a struggle. When she began receiving treatment from three PT students working as clinical interns, Raymond watched them as they tried to improve her physical condition and made sure she was comfortable with any treatment they did. The therapists were able to have her walking with a walker (having standby assistance), after she was unable to stand. Following, he thought this is something he could see himself doing, as how could there be a better profession than this: providing a service to people and improving their function/lives after sustaining injury or having a condition that caused changes, which led to a decline in a person's physical ability to function, may it be secondary to pain, limitation of motion, or weakness",,0

Sun Closed","Corinthian Physical Therapy was established in 1992 as one of the first one on one, hourly manual therapy private practices in New York City. Our team of highly experienced manual physical therapists take an osteopathic approach when evaluating and treating you. That means they observe and assess your whole body and concentrate on the interconnections of all body parts, treating the source of the problems and not just the symptoms. Many of Corinthian Therapy patients receiving physical therapy progress to a one on one Pilates-based exercise program in our private, open air Pilates studio which includes state of the art equipment including the Balance Body Pilates reformer, wunda chair, and spring board.
After many years of experience treating orthopedic patients, including supervisory positions at The Hospital for Special Surgery, Pam Schwarzer, the owner and founder of Corinthian Physical Therapy decided to open up a different kind of practice.After her own experiences with the treatment of her debilitating low back pain caused by years of long distance running, Pam realized that proper treatment requires time spent with the patient and a high degree of varied skills to approach the patient's needs. Pam found that the combination of her physical therapy background, augmented by her studies at the renowned osteopathic program at Michigan State University, practiced in a personalized home-like environment resulted in more dramatic and rapid whole body improvements for her patients",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8Qpy_6jfX2QztGF2IPdmjw/l.jpg,5

It's not a choice that most gyms--or even many trainers--accommodate well, however, with a one-size-fits-all attitude that is anything but personal.  That's the challenge that drove me to become a personal trainer: the need for fitness options that go beyond sweat, push and lose the fat, to move, breathe and feel inspired. A routine that gives you both the tools and the motivation to reach your fitness goals--whatever those goals may be.I work only with individuals or small groups, to ensure that every person finds the workout that suits him or her best. After assessing your fitness level now and discussing what you hope to achieve, I develop a personalized program that uses ASCM methods and incorporates techniques or trends that inspire you. My goal is to help you reach yours.
As a person who has been part of corporate America but passionate about fitness and sports, I decided to make a change for the better. Inspired by Laura was born. Gyms are wonderful but not necessary. Fitness can happen wherever you are with just your body.Care is taken to assess current fitness levels and apply ACSM supported methods to reach your desired goals.

We tend to curse a lot, we tell a lot of silly (and often risquxc3xa9) jokes as teaching tools, and we spend as much time laughing as we do grunting with effort.

They became...Ninjas!Built on the success of Snatched, the Mark Fisher Fitness Clubhouse officially opened its doors in New York City in January 2012.

Our striptease classes are designed by students, teachers and former exotic dancers who have mastered their skills in the art of exotic dance, lap dance, floor work, seduction, twerk, striptease and more. We teach sexy and easy to learn exotic dance moves that make you feel super hot. We also explain why the moves work so well on your special honey and how to leave them begging for more. We even have a BJ class! No Pole Needed. Learn Hot Moves That You Can Perform in Your Own Home With Out Any Extra Equipment. Let's face it. We don't all have poles in our bedrooms. Our classes will give you the moves to perform an extremely hot lap dance and routine for your partner, or just yourself, with nothing more than a chair and a smile. Add to your pole dance routines or step away from the pole completely! Great for Groups Such as Birthday, Girl's Night Out or Bachelorette Parties. Online Classes too. Can't make it to class, watch tutorials online or join live classes with your favorite instructor. Get more info on our site.
We saw the cardio striptease craze explode, and then the pole fitness classes. However, we kept meeting women who were taking fitness classes to learn dance moves so that they could look at themselves in that mirror and feel SEXY. It was a means to an end. And these women couldn't use what they had learned. The pole moves were fabulous, but they couldn't duplicate them in their own homes. And we, as former exotic dancers were so disappointed to see that the women who were teaching striptease classes HAD NOT EVEN SET FOOT IN A STRIP CLUB! We wanted to teach women sexy moves that they could actually perform for their lovers...or just for themselves, in the comfort of their own bedroom with no equipment needed. We wanted to highlight the sexuality behind the movement to help women connect with their partners and their bodies. We knew confidence in the bedroom leads to a better more fulfilling sex life and who doesn't want that?",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VWVuUAI2LBOzPO6rsE9oow/l.jpg,80

Beyond Pilates / Integrated Fitness Center owner, Ed Morand, got his start as an instructor at  the NY Sports Clubs/Town Sport Int'l chain.  After a quick rise to Master Trainer status he soon became a member of their Training and Development faculty responsible for educating both Pilates instructors and personal trainers in the fundamentals of fitness and exercise science .  It is this fusion of state-of-the-art ideas which gave rise to Beyond Pilates/Integrated Fitness Center.  Morand noticed a need for greater inclusion of the fitness sciences in Pilates exercise selection and program design.  While he also noticed that fitness instructors and personal trainers might benefit by adding the qualitative elements of Pilates technique to their work.  The overall goal at Beyond Pilates is to integrate both well-founded principles of exercise science and mechanics as well as recent innovations in research to bring our clients the best version of the the body they were born in",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/fNP4KzxPjlYisjHrzkJyfQ/l.jpg,19

Sensual Movement is a movement to bring the beautiful dance of Sensual Bachata to New York City. We started as a small team of passionate dancers in January 2016 and have grown the Sensual Bachata dance community to the thousands of members. Our unique approach hiring professional instructors, providing beautiful venues, doing things different from the norm, and truly caring for our customers has allowed us to grow and keep expanding the movement not only in New York, but also other states around the country. In September of 2018, we launched our first dance festival, Evolution Dance Festival, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and it is now ranked as one of the top 5 festivals in the United States. With the same intensity that led us to start this movement, we will continue to grow this community and show the world the beauty, art, appeal, and passion that is Sensual Bachata",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QEkPayqJI1vjr3bIDhUEsA/l.jpg,1

Expect not only the highest quality training through unmatchable teaching abilities, but an undying commitment from our teachers to have you meet all of your salsa dancing goals. Our motto is to teach students in a way that is simple and effective. Instructors break down fancy moves into fun to learn steps so you can dance with confidence and style in a welcoming and social atmosphere. We are not about memorizing routines. We teach our students to dance naturally by developing a core dance repertoire and internalizing these steps through drills and repetition.

After many years of performances, instruction, and practice, Yaisuri Salamanca became aware of the importance of having the most correct dance shoes. Here is her story:It has always been really hard for me to buy shoes. My size is not on the shoe retail market. I couldn't find shoes that fit and most shoe retailers have little patience for special orders. One time, I won a prize from a competition in Argentina. The prize was a pair of tango shoes. I received my voucher and went with excitement to claim my prize. I was so excited to see so many beautiful tango shoes. I tried one pair after another, but I ended up getting a pair that was the less painful to wear. It was then that I decided to create my own line of professional dance shoes for men and women. I focused on stylish-functional designs which combine beauty, comfort, and stability. I established my business in the year 2011 even though I have been working with custom orders since 2005",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_Kv9f75ohQyqGkNFvn5c4A/l.jpg,3

Throughout the years, owners Morgan, Bonnie and Karen have experienced many life milestones, always finding light and happiness within each other. Morgan's positive attitude towards life was greatly influenced by yoga and movement meditation and when she introduced Bonnie to the world of yoga, Bonnie's world was forever changed. Since then, both have been regular yoga students and their practice has evolved into a business dream. Their passion is to bring yoga to the people! Bonnie's sister-in-law Karen has since been an integral part in making this dream a reality. While on a family vacation, Bonnie took Karen to her first yoga class and Karen immediately saw the vision and jumped on board to help build WARRIOR&amp;CO.

We incorporate conscious breath (Pranayama), throughout each class to help our students trigger their relaxation response and turn their senses inward, concentrating on listening to their bodies and tuning out the outside world we come to a place of silence and self-awareness in our final relaxation and guided meditation.  It is through this silence that we begin to honor our bodies, our needs, our core being",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_YRIeEz_805vYXEH3xkmhQ/l.jpg,4

Promoting healthier, more vibrant beings on all levels, yet beginning within... is what Inner Shift Healing is all about.  Whether Breathwork, Reiki, or Reiki Massage, I can help you release the blocks that are holding you back from your best life. Sessions will leave you feeling more alive, balanced, and centered in your body.  Need distance healing??  YES!!! I CAN DO THAT!!!
Well, in 2007 I had hit my rock bottom and began to ask some serious questions, like what is it that i'm supposed to be doing in my life? Soon after, I discovered angels and they led me to my life's mission.  A series of synchronistic events ensued and I left my corporate career for a life in the healing arts.  Angelsbeside me, in 2012 we started On the Table - Healing Massage and helped bridge the gap between the physical &amp; ethereal worlds through energy healing (Reiki) and massage (Reiki Massage).As my inner work deepened, so did my clients'experiences and soon I realized that the name of the business no longer fit the mission.Inner Shift Healing was born in 2018 with its prime mission to assist people in their awakening process with such tools as Reiki, Reiki Massage, Breathwork, Meditation, and many others.If you feel stuck in some area of your life and are looking for a shift... You found the right place... Welcome to Inner Shift Healing!!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jHVDGvihy4ABWecMfw3xGg/l.jpg,132

For children, teens and adults.Most people mistakenly refer to all these arts as Karate, which is only one discipline of Martial Arts. We believe that no one system has all the answers and in order to be complete, one must learn all ranges of self-defense.
The Way of No Way was established in 2009, yet has been cultivating in a little boy's heart for the past 25 years. Through all the years of teaching and training, Sifu/Guro Reza Moazezi has developed a modern approach to cultural Martial Arts. From the style, appearance and energy of this Academy, to the finer training details, you can immediately tell this place is different. Our instructors take great pride in what they teach, as their knowledge has been handed down to them by some of the best Martial Artists in the world.

I like to focus on optimizing hormonal function through proper nutrition and utilizing the correct weight training and cardiovascular training techniques, in order to get your body working for you rather than against you. By building strength and teaching your body to work more efficiently, diet and exercise begins to feel less like work and more like a rewarding lifestyle that you can truly love and look forward to.

Orangetheory Fitness is a one-of-a-kind workout broken into intervals of cardiovascular and strength training, using a variety of equipment including treadmills, rowing, TRX straps, and free weights to tone your body and gain energy throughout the day.
The physiological theory behind the Orangetheory workout is known as Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption, or EPOC. By providing you with a heart rate monitor and POD, we can monitor your 5 zone interval training sessions that we call the Orange 60. During the 60 minute workout, you will perform multiple intervals designed to produce12 minutes or more of training at 84% or higher of your maximum heart rate, which translates to Zones 4/5. This program design produces EPOC, which is the workout after-burn effect, meaning that our interval training design produces a 200-400 calorie increase to your metabolism 24-36 hours after your workout",https://house-fastly.us-east-1.ooyala.com/RpcDNkajE6guNGOCOKeTqxpTa4J04IkR/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjBhOzV3Va,88

Our founders Maty Ezraty, Chuck Miller and Alan Finger were all serious and highly accomplished yoga practitioners who wanted to share the gifts they learned from their own wise teachers. In 1987, when they opened our first studio on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica, they gathered many styles of yoga under one roof, which attracted the best teachers in Southern California.As yoga gained popularity in the U.S., the demand for well-trained yoga teachers began to grow. With the help and inspiration of senior teachers Chuck Miller and Lisa Walford, Maty created the world-renowned YogaWorks Teacher Training Program in 1990. Based on direct teachings from Indian yoga masters, this program has formed and guided today's yoga leaders, including Seane Corn, Shiva Rea, Annie Carpenter, Natasha Rizopolus, Vinnie Marino, Kathryn Budig and many more",https://secure-cf-c.ooyala.com/ltOWd4YzE619cXmIjyiVJ-FlrXoNHJ0v/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjBhOzV3Va,55

Super easy once you get the hang of it.I will take you grocery shopping and explain how to read food labels.

Orangetheory Fitness is a one-of-a-kind workout broken into intervals of cardiovascular and strength training, using a variety of equipment including treadmills, rowing, TRX straps, and free weights to tone your body and gain energy throughout the day.
The physiological theory behind the Orangetheory workout is known as Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption, or EPOC. By providing you with a heart rate monitor and POD, we can monitor your 5 zone interval training sessions that we call the Orange 60. During the 60 minute workout, you will perform multiple intervals designed to produce 12 minutes or more of training at 84% or higher of your maximum heart rate, which translates to Zones 4/5. This program design produces EPOC, which is the workout after-burn effect, meaning that our interval training design produces a 200-400 calorie increase to your metabolism 24-36 hours after your workout",https://house-fastly.us-east-1.ooyala.com/RpcDNkajE6guNGOCOKeTqxpTa4J04IkR/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjBhOzV3Va,8

In 2007, Elissa spontaneously opened up to her healing gifts in a way that only the Universe could arrange-- an acute injury that found her unable to move from the waist-down upon awakening. After hours of laying immobile, she was struck with sudden insight and found herself reflexively performing a series of self-healing maneuvers that brought her to standing in 20 minutes. This astounding healing encounter immediately redirected her life &amp; career path. For over a decade, she's explored and practiced numerous forms of CAM therapies to deepen and master the healing tools she engaged with that day. In this time, she witnessed countless effective treatments and acquired knowledge, wisdom, and skills from the many generous expert practitioners who crossed her path. These experiences have invaluably informed her current-day practice, where she continues to employ the most effective healing and personal-development tools she comes across on her ongoing healing &amp; self-empowerment journey",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n6d0JnEzlrujeQhlydG3Pg/l.jpg,2

Try Ayurveda!Ayurveda (pronounced eye+ur+vay+duh) is a holistic system of medicine from India that incorporates the body, mind and consciousness when evaluating disease. It is the sister-science to yoga and the two are used hand in hand to resolve physical, emotional and energetic imbalances.Integrating the principles of ayurveda, yoga, and meditation I will custom design a wellness plan to achieve your goals. Energetic imbalances often manifest as undiagnosable symptoms. If left unchecked, these may worsen and eventually manifest into disease. Using a holistic, supportive approach, I target the root cause to address energetic imbalances that are causing your symptoms (stress, anxiety, migraines, bloating, constipation, sinus congestion, lethargy, emotional eating, tinnitus, acne, anger, insomnia, ADHD, etc.). I integrate holistic practices (diet, detox, meditation, yoga) to support individuals with cancer and chronic illnesses. Always encouraging, I keep you focused on positive changes.Food as Medicine: Hire me to prepare seasonally fresh whole foods for you or your family that will nourish your body and feed your soul. More than a chef, I am a wellness provider using food as my medium. Corporate Stress Reduction and Wellness Programs:Stress is the leading cause of sickness resulting in lost productivity and declining revenues for companies. Hire me for onsite or offsite stress reduction class (including meditation, yoga, healthy eating, etc.).

It transitioned to A4 Fitness where Strength &amp; Performance Training was added to the martial arts program.  A4 brought a family vibe to the gym.  In 2019 when the A4 owners decided to move their lives out of the city, they looked for new owners to continue the gym with the same attention to high quality training, while keeping the family atmosphere and close community.

Our students must complete a thirty minute commitment meeting with our staff prior to our commitment to train. We need assurance each student is making the commitment to train on their own and will submit to doing the hard work it takes to develop to their fullest potential. After our meeting we will go to the court for a full evaluation which is documented on video for future review. When the evaluation is complete we will discuss anything we see that needs to be improved upon, what needs to be done to correct them and how it's going to be done step-by-step. As player development advances we will continue to document through video each student progress to compare to earlier footage to show growth. Each student will be responsible for completing 30 minute of basketball homework each day which will be given by our training staff. training is progressive and the homework given is mandatory. We guarantee our training results 100%. Our students are also held to strict academic standards to assist with their college recruiting process.BDA develops boys and girls local-regional-national teams for those who wish to participate in the AAU events across the country.

Our center: - Offers classes and workshops to the general public, teaching the skills of mindfulness across the lifespan;- Fosters and publicizes research to support the scientific benefits of mindful awareness;- Brings mindfulness to professionals through UCLA's medical education program-including doctors, Medical students, staff and faculty;- Offers mindfulness tools and classes to support mental health professionals.
Mindful awareness can be defined as paying attention to present moment experiences with openness, curiosity, and a willingness to be with what is. It is an excellent antidote to the stresses of modern times. It invites us to stop, breathe, observe, and connect with one's inner experience. There are many ways to bring mindfulness into one's life, such as meditation, yoga, art, or time in nature. Mindfulness can be trained systematically, and can be implemented in daily life, by people of any age, profession or background.In the last ten years, significant research has shown mindfulness to address health issues such as lower blood pressure and boost the immune system; increase attention and focus, including aid those suffering from ADHD; help with difficult mental states such as anxiety and depression, fostering well-being and less emotional reactivity; and thicken the brain in areas in charge of decision making, emotional flexibility, and empathy",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8CgJMUVtYwiYBZHCAib5OA/l.jpg,8

Postures have to be adapted to the individual. While there are particular sequences of postures that we teach, they are taught according to the level of the student. Some students are fit, and can learn more quickly, in a vigorous manner. Some are less fit, or have health conditions, and need to move more slowly.

I started taking group yoga classes in New York city in 2005. This was something I did to get stronger, more flexible and more resilient to stress from a fast pace life in the Big Apple. Although I enjoyed the effects of yoga, I did not develop full appreciation for it till I met a dear friend of mine and an accomplished yogi, Eric Powell. It was him who introduced Ramaswami's works to me. It took me many months before I actually took a look at the book Eric recommended, The Complete Book of Vinyasa Yoga. When I moved to San Francisco in January 2010, I thought I should check out Ramaswami's teachings at Esalen Institute. In May 2010, I took a 5 day Hatha Yoga Practicum with Srivatsa Ramaswami at Esalen and immediately decided to continue my studies with him.  In June of that year I went to Los Angeles to study with him for 5 weeks at the Vinyasa Krama Teacher Training Program.

So why wait?? Let's get started and become who you NEED to become.
Every single day as I wake up and bike through the streets of Downtown LA, I see people from overweight to underweight individual who need guidance in achieving a healthier life style. I made it my goal to help as many people as I can which brought this business idea to light. I want to educate, motivate, and support individual who has lost all confidence in themselves or in life and make them see that there is a brighter future for them",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GWT5g3rxc3QSwy7fBFjytg/l.jpg,12

For example: should they dislike a particular part of the lesson, they may choose to do that part last.  3) Unbinding time constraints on learning each skill during each lesson.  For example: Some students need more time learning the proper kicking technique, while others may need more time with jumping, or arm stroke.  And 4) Sailfish Swim School is a traveling swim school.  With more and more time constraints on parents, traveling and lesson time just isn't available.

Using Functional Integrated Therapy, a variety of techniques are utilized to optimize an individual's treatment program. These include chiropractic, pilates, yoga, massage, core/strength training, mind-body therapy and acupuncture. Each patient has a unique set of symptoms and goals which require a treatment program designed specifically for them. Too often, the source of injury is not addressed, especially with regard to the musuloskeletal system. Pills are prescribed and short term treatments are used to help alleviate the pain in specific areas. Unfortunately, the overall physical dysfunction is not considered and the patient often has recurring symptoms and additional injuries. Our approach is to work with patients to address the core problem and develop a course of treatment to correct it.

Orangetheory Fitness is a one-of-a-kind workout broken into intervals of cardiovascular and strength training, using a variety of equipment including treadmills, rowing, TRX straps, and free weights to tone your body and gain energy throughout the day.
The physiological theory behind the Orangetheory workout is known as Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption, or EPOC. By providing you with a heart rate monitor and POD, we can monitor your 5 zone interval training sessions that we call the Orange 60. During the 60 minute workout, you will perform multiple intervals designed to produce12 minutes or more of training at 84% or higher of your maximum heart rate, which translates to Zones 4/5. This program design produces EPOC, which is the workout after-burn effect, meaning that our interval training design produces a 200-400 calorie increase to your metabolism 24-36 hours after your workout",https://house-fastly.us-east-1.ooyala.com/RpcDNkajE6guNGOCOKeTqxpTa4J04IkR/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjBhOzV3Va,46

Orangetheory Fitness is a one-of-a-kind workout broken into intervals of cardiovascular and strength training, using a variety of equipment including treadmills, rowing, TRX straps, and free weights to tone your body and gain energy throughout the day.
The physiological theory behind the Orangetheory workout is known as Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption, or EPOC. By providing you with a heart rate monitor and POD, we can monitor your 5 zone interval training sessions that we call the Orange 60. During the 60 minute workout, you will perform multiple intervals designed to produce12 minutes or more of training at 84% or higher of your maximum heart rate, which translates to Zones 4/5. This program design produces EPOC, which is the workout after-burn effect, meaning that our interval training design produces a 200-400 calorie increase to your metabolism 24-36 hours after your workout",https://house-fastly.us-east-1.ooyala.com/RpcDNkajE6guNGOCOKeTqxpTa4J04IkR/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjBhOzV3Va,65

In 2002 Sensei Poretz came to the conclusion that his next step as a martial artist would be to start a program of his own. So with 5 children from his synagogue he began KSK martial arts at the Jewish Community Center in Woodland Hills. The program became one of the most popular classes at the center and it quickly became apparent that they would outgrow the facility. A suitable location was soon found and the Kenshokan took up residence at 21151 Victory Blvd in Woodland Hills. In December we will be celebrating our 8th anniversary. The dojo has had some great success with several students becoming champions",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3tQVu7f-0FIZYt6o5i0dpw/l.jpg,19

Our programs include high intensity cardiovascular workouts which include stretching, breathing, focus, and conditioning for all our members. Our style includes the art of eight limbs which includes hand, feet, elbow, and knee combinations as part of our curriculum. Our philosophy is to learn all the same basics and philosophies of a world champion from the beginning. Doesn't matter whether you're a kid or an adult, come and experience the heat and burn calories with the best in the business. First-timers, come and experience a free class and train with  professional Coach Victor Alvarez, and BCBC State Champion Kevin Gonzalez all mentored by legendary trainer and manager Coach David Krapes.
In 2011, Janjira Fitness was formerly known as Where Champions Are Made and was founded by 12-Time Welterweight World Champion Hector Pena The Aztec Warrior. In 2015, he passed away and his legacy was continued by legends' fighter trainer Coach David Krapes and partner Rob Harper of Harper's Bar and Grill. They rebranded the gym to Janjira Fitness and kept Where Champions Are Made as the motto. The name Janjira is synonymous with the legendary Thai fighter from Thailand, Saekson Janjira, who David had worked closely with and helped train. Saekson operates his business today in Dallas, Texas. Today, we continue the legacy by mentoring our students under the philosophies of Muay Thai and kickboxing. We believe that all students should learn the discipline of The Art of Eight Limbs (Muay Thai), Urquidez kickboxing, and boxing to have a well-rounded off stand up martial art",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TMSaPIV7LwRGfNCSBG0rBA/l.jpg,1

Sun Closed","Flight School is barre 2.0. A fresh more effective update to the old barre routine. See the video at our website. Scientific evidence indicates that the ballerina body is not created simply by plies. The ballet body is actually developed by ballet jumping which forces the body to create the long lean muscle called type 2 fast twitch fiber. Type 2 is what gives a ballerina a lean but rock solid appearance and it is only created through explosive mevement. At ALIGN we don't care what you look like but if you want specific results you need a very specific fitness program and Flight School delivers the ballet body secret sauce. Any program without athletic ballet jumping in not going to have the desired results, it is simply not possible. Plus it is FUN! Yet jumping is optional and this program is for anyone at any fitness level. ALIGN founder Michael Cornell has designed a program that is easily modified for all levels of fitness. You may do this workout no, low, or high impact, it's your choice! We primarily teach straight up ballet classes but Flight School is used by many of our students to increase their strength and endurance. Cardio, strength, core, balance, flexibility, and endurance Flight School provided it all in a simple 1 hour no prior experience necessary body blast. Come try it out. Use promo code flynow for a free single class credit.
Flight School is a new workout program designed by Align Ballet Method founder Michael Cornell. This is a workout for those students who may not want a strict classical ballet experience that we typically provide. Flight School gives you all intensity of ballet without the complex choreography. Fun, dynamic, and incredibly effective. Flight School will rock your body!",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/EUHGF_o6EEwkAMi_t_vDzg/l.jpg,4

I teach classes out of spaces in West Hollywood and Santa Monica, where I also host yoga parties and retreats.  I welcome students from all walks of life but have a special place in my heart for helping women feel empowered and connected.

Founder, owner, and artistic director Roni Blak meticulously curated this unique place in Brentwood where kids grow, thrive, and connect through the art of dance and movement. The #MNRDF staff includes supportive and professional instructors who provide dance instruction to children of all ages and experience levels. #MNRDF is a studio specifically designed for dance. Students will learn the foundation, performance, practice, and art of dance in a nurturing setting that will become their second home. Faculty is meticulously chosen for their professional skills and teaching abilities. Instructors such as Annie Guest, have experience working with children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other motor/developmental disorders, making dance accessible to all. The Benefits of Dance for Children Dance has physical, social, cognitive, and emotional benefits for children. They learn body awareness, balance, and coordination. It develops muscle strength and encourages good posture. Children who dance are more socially aware. Through dance, they learn how to cooperate, share, interact with others, and communicate. Most importantly, exposure to proper dance instruction helps build confidence in children. #MNRDF is multi-generational - parents return with their own children to receive the same caliber of instruction they experienced.

I get a good idea of how a person moves to determine from the beginning what may be contributing cause of the onset of pain (other than an obvious injury).  I then focus on hands-on techniques to relieve pain quickly, using myofascial release and cupping as needed.  Once pain is reduced, focus moves to the biomechanical aspects, rom and strength deficits that contribute to the onset of pain.  I use pilates and yoga as well as DNS and Janda techniques (more information found on my website.) With nearly 20 years of experience I've seen it al.  I treat all post surgical cases, including total hip and knee replacements (tkr, thr), all painful movement dysfunctions from the neck to the ankles and everything in between, including arthritis.  As an athlete who has dealt with pain, I've learned what works best for quick results. I love my geriatric (Medicare) physical therapy clients as well.

Sun Closed","My approach to physical therapy starts with an assessment of one's biomechanics, posture, joint and soft tissue mobility and range of motion and strength.  I get a good idea of how a person moves to determine from the beginning what may be contributing cause of the onset of pain (other than an obvious injury).  I then focus on hands-on techniques to relieve pain quickly, using myofascial release and cupping as needed.  Once pain is reduced, focus moves to the biomechanical aspects, rom and strength deficits that contribute to the onset of pain.  I use pilates and yoga as well as DNS and Janda techniques (more information found on my website.) I treat all post surgical cases, including  total hip and knee replacements (tkr, thr), all painful movement dysfunctions from the neck to the ankles and everything in between, including arthritis.  As an athlete who has dealt with pain, I've learned what works best for quick results. I love my geriatric (Medicare) physical therapy clients as well. They often need patience and time and a gentle hand.I also do home visits for cash, Medicare and ppo blue shield clients.
Since the year 2000, Anne McArthur has been a professional beach volleyball player, using her experience as an athlete and a patient to develop a great understanding of pain and how to eliminate it.  She has been working with all types of cases and all ages for over 18 years in various locations across Los Angeles.  She discovered cupping more than 10 years ago and has developed her own techniques for every body part.  She has an excellent reputation for being able to quickly relieve your pain, and uses pilates and yoga based exercises, as well as her own therapeutic inventions in her rehabilitation programs.  After working at the International Orthopedic Center for Joint disorders for 15 years Anne opened her own practice, Holistic Physical Therapy and Wellness, Inc. located at 12401 Wilshire Blvd, Ste 205, Los angeles, CA 90025.

He later received an advanced certifications in weight training and Pilates. He employed elements of traditional Pilates mixed with weight training and cardio. But as he progressed he became aware of the holes and limitations inherent in the physical fitness methods he was employing and therefore created his own.Sebastien created the first Proformer and started to operate with it in December 21st, 2005. Since 2006, there has been many versions of the Proformer and generations. The 2nd generation is called the Megaformer and now a 3rd generation called the Supra, each evolutionary version revealing new and innovative designs .
The Lagree Fitness xe2x84xa2 training method was developed in 2005 and is taught on an exclusive technology developed by fitness visionary, Sebastien Lagree. Physical fitness is more than being able to run a long distance or lift heavy weights at the gym; or how long you worked out or at what intensity... While these are important measures of fitness, they only address single areas. Physical fitness is made up of five basic elements: Cardio, Strength, Endurance, Body Composition, and Flexibility. Where many workouts and exercise regimens work to integrate as many of these elements as possible, Lagree Fitnessxe2x84xa2 meets all the elements to physical fitness; not just in 1 session but in each and every move.Parking is off of Westmount Dr in the private underground lot.

The various techniques I use integrates ancient eastern wisdom with western scientific and psychological understanding. They cover a wide range of body-oriented therapies from strongly physical, deep-tissue massage to the most subtle energy work.Each of the practices explores the art of flow: the natural, effortless unwinding of our lives in a way that moves us toward wholeness and harmony. Its focus is to cultivate harmonious, balanced movement and flow rhythm on all levels, such as physical, emotional, mental, energetic, and spiritual. Flow is central to my work because it is essential to our health and well-being. Communication and coordination between all of our parts require the smooth flow of biochemical and electromagnetic signals through our fluids, tissues, and bones. The fluidity of our emotions and thoughts enables us to harmonize our inner world and to be flexible and resilient in our dealings with the outer world. Increased awareness in the art of flow invites us to connect with our inherent capacity to heal. Harmonious flow is relevant in today's world, not only for our health but also for our relationships, careers, and personal growth - we can become more healthy, connected, abundant, and energized.
I am also one of the founders of Padma NYC meditation and holistic center along with Nicholas Waterfall. Our love and passion are to create a safe, aesthetic environment where people can relax and heal, returning to their daily lives recharged and better able to face the challenges of living in a big urban environment like New York City.

We believe the success with which our current and past students navigate the water proves our program's effectiveness.The most important aspect of our teaching process is our disciplined but loving dedication to getting children in and comfortable with the water. We are thoughtful and observant of student's behavioral and developmental patterns, and will never scare or intimidate a student. We will respond to their fears and concerns with love, humor and discipline, while guiding them through the necessary steps to become independent, competent swimmers.We deeply enjoy helping with children with special needs and development issues.  They are some of our favorite and best students!  The aquatic environment can provide them with a unique athletic experience other sports cannot.This firm, loving approach is the hallmark of SwimJim.
SwimJim was started in one location with 4 team members and 60 clients.  We only had lessons one day a week. Since that time SwimJim has expanded to multiple locations around New York City and has opened in the Hamptons and Houston Texas. The school now operates 7 days a week and 50 weeks out of the year. During that time of growth we created the Underwater Schoolhouse Teaching methodology added elite level swimmer and Olympic Gold Medalist Catherine Fox to the educational development team.  Together Jim and Catherine have developed a program that is world renowned and they have lectured and done clinics around the world. Their focus is on educating the whole person by addressing the emotional needs as well as the physical needs of the student. As SwimJim Continues to expand and grow, the entire team is focused on learning and discovering new ways to grow, educate and teach all people how to be safer in, on and around the water and enjoy the magic of swimming",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5G8iEt31SndmXyISIAjA2w/l.jpg,0

Seeking to integrate and celebrate the different teachings and lineages that passed through their ashram, Mani and Alan created ISHTA Yoga.In 1975, Alan moved to the United States, settling in Los Angeles and co-founding Yoga Works. In 1993, Alan relocated to New York City and formed the Yoga Zone studios. Yoga Zone became Be Yoga and expanded Alan's teachings into one of the most successful regional yoga teacher training programs in the country. Coming full circle, in 2004 Be Yoga rejoined the Yoga Works family of studios.As the culmination of his life-long development of ISHTA, Alan and his partners opened the first ISHTA Yoga studio in Manhattan in May 2008, at 56 East 11th Street. For the first time, all elements of the ISHTA tradition had a dedicated home. In February 2011, ISHTA opened the doors to its uptown studio, located at 1026 Third Avenue",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/702MTt9mBNyt91EFdb7Qog/l.jpg,119

Brooklyn, NYI'm SOOO grateful that I found this place! Before I decided to sign up for Three Sisters Yoga 200 hours teacher training I did huge research. Many schools were offering the training, but they were way too expensive! TSY has the most affordable training in NYC and excellent quality! The head of the training, Jen Whinnen, has almost 20 years experience in yoga and about 10 years of experience in teaching yoga teachers. What I love the most about her is that she is very a practical teacher.We had 17 students in the room, everyone got enough attention and knowledge from the teachers.  Also, everyone had a personal mentor who was helping during the whole process.After graduation I found a job in 3 different studios almost right a way (within 1.5 month to be exact). I'm also continuing my eduction with the TSY 300 hour program.
I was first introduced to Jen 5 years ago. Jen has a very unique blend of being totally down to earth and able to speak to the most esoteric philosophies in a highly intelligent attainable way. She has an ability to articulate the basic or advanced philosophies of Yoga, Taoism, Jung, Buddhism and her own ideas of the world and spirituality. Nothing feels unattainable when Jen is talking or teaching.-Erin Moon, RYT (NYC) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Jen was one of my teachers when I was training to become certified in Winter of '08.  Jen was my favorite instructor, and she has a way of being extremely approachable, authentic, and relate-able through her warmth and compassionate demeanor.  Her humor and way of maintaining class attention was colored with an openness that is hard to come by. One would be lucky to have her as a teacher. --Rosalind Ting, RYT",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jjEaGx751ZxcazYswmC5aw/l.jpg,4

You can find the schedule of classes at the Sacred Brooklyn website.If you want to take private or semi-private (up to 3 people) Unnataxc2xae Aerial Yoga classes, visit the small home studio of Founder, Michelle Dortignac, in the Clinton Hill area of Brooklyn. You can find more information on the Unnata website. If you want to practice at home, you can find downloadable videos on the Unnata website on the Vimeo page. We have made some videos for people who don't have a hammock at home, too.For your comfort, we recommend wearing clothing that covers the back of the knees and the armpits. Also try to avoid low-cut and/or loose clothing as clothing may shift around when upside-down. Learn how to achieve proper postural alignment through relaxation rather than effort, enhancing a peaceful state of mind.Unnata Aerial Yoga supports your traditional Yoga practice in the following ways:    * Challenging traditional Yoga postures such as inversions and deep backbends can be achieved without effort and without strain.    * Deep muscle releases achieved in the air allow students to explore much deeper stretches in their traditional Yoga postures on the floor.    * Using an Aerial Yoga hammock can avoid common Yoga-related injuries such as over stretching the shoulders and too much compression in the lower back.
Michelle Dortignac has been a certified yoga instructor since 1998, and an aerial acrobatic performer since 2004. With an interest in helping her yoga students better understand proper alignment and the true purpose of yoga, she created the Unnata Aerial Yoga style in 2006, and continues to develop it today.Students use a Yoga hammock to dangle only inches off the ground. The hammock helps mold students' bodies into the shapes of traditional yoga postures through relaxation rather than muscular effort. This is what distinguishes Unnata Aerial Yoga from other fitness trends as well as from many other yoga techniques -- because gravity is already a strong force, students must learn to reduce the amount of effort they use. Once students have an idea of what the shape of the yoga posture is supposed to feel like, and which muscles they must relax in order for the shape to unfold, they have an easier time refinding that same posture on the floor, even without the assistance of the hammock",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/e6s3dO4BxebS7DY_sWo17Q/l.jpg,10

Our teachers come from eclectic backgrounds and offer insights from many different lineages and schools.  We recognize that Yoga comes from a colorful past. We welcome practitioners of all styles. Feel at home here to make your practice your own.We have structured our schedule to allow for a drop-in, pay-as-you-go experience.   We do not require sign-ups or registration. Yoga is an effective way to strengthen the body, calm the mind, and heighten the spirit, so we encourage everyone to practice as often as possible.Our studio was inspired by the teachings of Jules Febre and Rima Rani Rabbath of the international Jivamukti Yoga School.
Brahman Yoga was opened in May 2014, shortly after a team of scientists in Antarctica discovered evidence that the universe inflated into being faster than the speed of light.  Our universe, undoubtedly, is place of expansion.  Our studio was built to follow that example.  Yoga is a practice of opening our bodies, opening our minds, and opening our hearts.  It can be difficult to live in a universe of uncertainties.  Sometimes light travels as a particle, other times as a wave.  But when we demand answers and certainties, we usually find ourselves in conflict with the universe.  If, instead, we choose to expand our feelings and experiences, we might turn that conflict into a new connection.  Our studio's intention is to learn the importance of opening new space",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/d0KIEQJIUB1hMTaYL-DtMg/l.jpg,53

According to the American Heart Association, physical activity will improve your overall quality of life. This notion is shared among most health institutions. Though learning how to swim is considered as a safety precaution for preventing a series of accidents when in or around water, swimming has been scientifically tested to improve one's well-being because it is part of a complete exercise regimen. It is considered to have the least amount of stress on joints with benefits like improved flexibility, strength, coordination, and aerobic prowess. Studies also show that the body becomes naturally inclined to consume more oxygen during high-intensity phases of exercise, which strengthens the lungs and allows swimmers to breathe at greater ease during rest. Aerobic exercise also decreases resting heart rate and blood pressure. The health benefits resulting of two to three 30 minute swim sessions each week can ultimately transform your lifestyle and drastically improve your overall well-being. You don't need to become an Olympic swimmer in order to enjoy the maximum benefits of aerobic exercises. However, you do need to challenge yourself. Here at Splash Fit Swimming, we encourage swimming to be used as a tool for great mental and physical health!
Splash Fit Swimming was founded by a group of aquatic instructors and coaches in Harlem teaching minority communities basic swimming skills and water safety awareness. With an epidemic of people drowning in the city, we wanted to expand our services where teaching a necessary life-saving skill has been our number one priority. We use advanced teaching techniques on levels based upon ability to promote learning. Our team adjusts the stroke curriculum to meet each swimmer's specific needs so that they can learn at their own pace, not only making sure that our clients are more comfortable around all aspects of aquatics, but ensuring that they develop a skill set that can be used for the rest of their lives. Our mission is to help participants reach their personal goals, whether it's for safety around water, staying healthy, competing at an elite level, or recreation",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pVD_KCK4HDAMjirwCIypFA/l.jpg,3

Orangetheory Fitness is a one-of-a-kind workout broken into intervals of cardiovascular and strength training, using a variety of equipment including treadmills, rowing, TRX straps, and free weights to tone your body and gain energy throughout the day.
The physiological theory behind the Orangetheory workout is known as Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption, or EPOC. By providing you with a heart rate monitor and POD, we can monitor your 5 zone interval training sessions that we call the Orange 60. During the 60 minute workout, you will perform multiple intervals designed to produce12 minutes or more of training at 84% or higher of your maximum heart rate, which translates to Zones 4/5. This program design produces EPOC, which is the workout after-burn effect, meaning that our interval training design produces a 200-400 calorie increase to your metabolism 24-36 hours after your workout",https://house-fastly.us-east-1.ooyala.com/RpcDNkajE6guNGOCOKeTqxpTa4J04IkR/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjBhOzV3Va,52

This, our first location, had no locker rooms, the air conditioning didn't work and after hours break-ins were perennial events. However, while we lacked the resources to equip the gym with some basic amenities and strong locks we were on an important mission - to make exercise fun. And, accomplishing this mission meant doing away with traditional notions of what a 'serious' workout should be. What we did was invite a highly creative group of fitness instructors with a wide range of expertise to collaborate with us. The result was the development of challenging programming with a completely fresh slant. Offerings like Hip-Hop Aerobics, Co-Ed Action Wrestling and Cyked Yoga Cycling were introduced and, along with others, became the embodiment of this new approach",https://secure-cf-c.ooyala.com/BtZTBoMzE6-7-rO4LzNiXBaphqnumP1p/Ut_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjBhOzV3Va,45

When you enjoy what you are doing, reaching goals will always seem easier. The time, calories and stress of your day disappear, round-by-round. After an hour, you will leave physically exhausted but mentally refreshed.Forget running on a machine. Forget Simon-Says aerobics classes. Forget monotonous free-weights and machines.

A trim physique and self-confidence are inevitable side effects of a balanced workout.
There is a stigma regarding boxing that we are doing our part to eliminate. Boxing is so much more than learning to hurt someone and it is nothing about the glamorization of violence. Sure, some of our members and many of our trainers have been in the ring on a competitive level, but these folks are exceptions to the rule in modern boxing facilities such as ours. AND, unless we told you who they were, you would never know. They are the nicest folks around and they truly love their sport.

Sun Closed","Seido Karate is a traditional Japanese style of karate, into which its founder, Kaicho Tadashi Nakamura has distilled the essence of what he has learned about the martial arts in over 50 years of study, practice, and teaching.The World Seido Karate Organization officially opened its headquarters on October 15, 1976, in New York City. We are now a worldwide organization, with thriving branches throughout the United States and in such diverse places as Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, South Africa, and South America. Nevertheless, within Seido, growth of our branch schools is not pursued for its own sake. Quality of instruction and development of the student is paramount.The physical training in Seido can be strenuous, emphasizing progressive development of strength, flexibility and aerobic capacity. In addition to developing students with the highest level of physical skill, Seido aims to develop individuals of the highest moral character.
The Staten Island Seido Karate dojo was founded by Jun-Shihan EdEllington in 1981. In 2007, upon his retirement from teaching, Kyoshi Roger Esposito was appointed Branch Chief Instructor for the Staten Island dojo. Kyoshi Roger and the other instructors have been instrumental in teaching students how to defend and protect oneself physically, while gaining confidence and self discipline, in order to meet the challenges of daily life. They instill the Seido Karate Bushido Spirit of facing challenges head on while always conducting oneself with respect, love and obedience",https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6s9gGOysjlR31AyEDv10cw/l.jpg,3
